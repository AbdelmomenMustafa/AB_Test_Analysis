## A/B Test Analysis: Evaluating the Impact of a New Website Feature on User Engagement and Conversion
Project Overview
This project aims to assess the effectiveness of a new website feature through an A/B test. By comparing user behavior and conversion rates between the control and experimental groups, we can determine the impact of the new feature on user engagement and conversion.

# Project Structure
. data: This directory contains the dataset used for the A/B test.<br />
. notebooks: Here, you'll find the Jupyter Notebook with the code for data analysis and hypothesis testing.<br />
. README.md: The main readme file providing an overview of the project and instructions.<br />
. Dataset Description
  The dataset consists of user interaction data collected during the A/B test. It is provided in CSV format and includes relevant variables such as user ID, group   assignment, timestamps, and conversion status. Prior to analysis, the dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.

# Methodology
The A/B test was designed to randomly assign users to either the control or experimental group. Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis techniques, such as t-tests and confidence intervals, were employed to compare user behavior metrics and conversion rates between the two groups.

# Results and Insights
The analysis revealed several key findings:

User engagement metrics, such as average time spent on the website and number of page views, showed no significant differences between the control and experimental groups.
However, the experimental group exhibited a higher conversion rate compared to the control group, suggesting that the new feature positively influenced user conversion.
Instructions
To reproduce the analysis:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Open the Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks directory.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the A/B test analysis demonstrated that the new website feature had a positive impact on user conversion rates. These findings support the implementation of the feature to improve overall user engagement and drive business goals.
